Basically a \nreverse-proxy site where you can \"chop\" in assets that need development.  \n\nIdeally, you have access to the code-base but it requires a difficult environment or heavy SDK (say \ngoodbye to slow Virtual Machines and/or bloated IDEs) that are unnecessary for static assets such as \nCSS, Images, or JavaScript.  You can edit locally (helpful for pre-compiled css or coffee-script \nwhich can be watched for changes, compiled and previewed on-the-fly) and still use your \napplication's data routes or dynamic pages.\n\n**Full disclosure**\nLets get real for a second.  This project was developed out of a ton of frustration working with \nfront-end, static assets coupled too tightly with a .NET project and my ever-growing hatred for \nMicrosoft Visual Studio.\n\n### Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install butchershop --save-dev\n```\n\n### Use\nYou can create a new butcherhop and chop entire directories(shown below) or specific files (see the examles/example.js)\n\nIncluded in ./examples is, well... an example and can be run by `cd ./example; node example.js`.  Below is a bare-bones implementation: \n\n```js\n// require and set-up the server object.\nvar Butchershop = require('../index.js');\nvar butcher = new Butchershop({\n    proxy: { host: 'npmjs.org' }\n});\n\n// chop any calls to '/stylus/*' to route to a local directory that mimics the same path\nbutcher.chop('/stylus/{path*}', './stylus-local');\nbutcher.start();\n```\n\nThe example included shows how to butcher the [npmjs.org](http://npmjs.org) site and intercept the \nstylesheets.  When you run the example you can expect to see the results below when visiting \n[localhost:8000/package/butchershop](http://localhost:8000/package/butchershop)  \n\n![./examples/example.js result](https://raw.github.com/ruzz311/butchershop/master/examples/butchershop.gif)\n",
